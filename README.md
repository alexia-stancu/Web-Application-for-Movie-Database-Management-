# Web-Application-for-Movie-Database-Management-
I developed a web application for managing a movie database, allowing users to view, add, edit, and delete films, producers, and actors. I designed and implemented a MySQL relational database with structured many-to-many (M:N) and one-to-many (1:N) relationships between movies, producers, and actors. I created an interactive JSP-based interface with HTML & CSS for easy navigation and data management. I integrated JavaBeans and JDBC to handle database queries and ensure efficient CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Additionally, I implemented error handling, validation mechanisms, user roles, and permissions to restrict access to sensitive information based on user type (e.g., admin, user).
